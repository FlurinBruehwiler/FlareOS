# FlareOS

The goal of this project is to create an operating system from scratch. The only function it should have is to run Minecraft. Not the real Minecraft but a [Minecraft Clone written in C](https://github.com/FlurinBruehwiler/MinecraftInC).

Notes are located [here](docs.md).

## Build & Running
